I am a PhD student at the Autism Therapy and Research Center at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics, and Psychotherapy at University Hospital Frankfurt (Germany). My research focuses on the multimodal assessment of restricted and repetitive behaviours as one core symptom domain of Autism Spectrum Disorder.

Before that, I received a Masters in Pedagogical and Clinical Psychology (2021) and a Bachelor in Psychology (2018) from [Goethe University Frankfurt](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/en "Goethe University Frankfurt").

Aside from research, I enjoy reading, swimming and cooking. My favourite cuisine is Afghan and Korean.
